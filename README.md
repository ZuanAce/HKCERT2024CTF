# HKCERT2024CTF
“HKCERT Capture The Flag 2024,” organised by the Hong Kong Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Centre (HKCERT) and the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC), is now in its fifth edition. It is one of the largest cybersecurity competitions in Hong Kong, featuring four categories: Secondary School, Tertiary, Open, and International. I enjoyed the creative user interface and the engaging challenges they provided. Despite having a busy weekend, I managed to solve two challenges and ranked 183rd out of 546 teams in the international category.
